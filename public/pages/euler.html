        <h1>Project Euler</h1>

        <p>
            The best way I've found to learn new programming concepts is to build a small project. 
            Sometimes I'll make a puzzle solver or a command line tool, but by far my favorite 
            project to work on is <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>. It's a collection of math problems designed to be solved with the aid of a computer.
            The problems are usually simple, but because they can be solved in many ways, they're useful for learning how to use new libraries.
        </p>

        <p>
            This page serves to document my progress in solving Project Euler problems. My initial goals in taking on this project were testing, benchmarking,
            iterators, paralellism, and optimization. My language of choice is Rust, which I believe to be one of the best programming languages for small
            projects. With one "cargo new" I can start coding with no further setup. Rust also has many mature libraries which can be incorporated into
            any project with ease. Additionally, Rust has a reputation for being fast and safe, which I will put to the test as I solve each problem.

            <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=1" target="_blank">Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5</a>
        </h3>

        <h4>
            If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

            Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
